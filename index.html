        <p>I absolutely love to learn  difficult skills. Whether it is weight lifting, music production, web development, or barbecuing, learning is a passion of mine. It is a total adventure! You have to hunt for knowledge: books, videos, tutorials, classes, network etc.  The feeling one gets after the struggle of learning something exciting and challenging is something I find unparalleled. A confidence and trust in oneself arises from such pursuits. It molds you into a better person, capable of overcoming obstacles. Success, failure, and persistence is the name of the game and I am totally addicted.

        </p>Some personal goals of mine are to release my music on A list House record labels, travel and tour the world as a house music producer and dj, open up a gym in a warehouse, have a family of my own, help the less fortunate realize their dreams, and learn how to code like a boss!

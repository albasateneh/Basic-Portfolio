        <p>I absolutely love to learn difficult skills. Whether it is weight lifting, music production, web
            development, or barbecuing, learning is a passion of mine. It is a total adventure! You have to hunt for
            knowledge: books, videos, tutorials, classes, network etc. The feeling one gets after the struggle of
            learning something exciting and challenging is something I find unparalleled. A confidence and trust in
            oneself arises from such pursuits. It molds you into a better person, capable of overcoming obstacles.
            Success, failure, and persistence is the name of the game and I am totally addicted.

            Some personal goals of mine are to release my music on A list House record labels, travel and tour the
            world as a house music producer and dj, open up a gym in a warehouse, have a family of my own, help the
            less
            fortunate realize their dreams, and learn how to code like a boss!</p>
